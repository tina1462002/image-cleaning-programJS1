# image-cleaning-programJS1
#I created this image cleaning and editing Python software as part of my Thomas College IT team internship and job to crop, re-orient/deskew, and rotate and organize scanned archival library material in preparation for it to become easily tagged with metadata, searchable and usable by researchers. I created it in the span of a month and a half using Python; the program can process, clean, and crop (with an arbitrary border) 30,000+ archival images saving Thomas College 1512 hours of manual labor (or 63 full days).
#To run, open VS code > Open folder > choose image_cleanerJSS > make sure code runner extension is on your VS code > press the run button at the top right > expand "IMAGE_CLEANERJSS" > open image_cleaner.py for code file > open deskewer for the second code file > expand input_images for originals > expand output_images1 for finals (and choose random images that were processsed)
